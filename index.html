My name is Pedro Cabrera, Iâ€™m an 18 year old student from the Dominican Republic. I like sports, especially table tennis, tennis and basketball. Regarding food, my favorite plate is rice and meat. The thing I most like about my country are the constant happiness people have on their faces.

<h2 class="text-justify"> About me </h2>
<p> <ul class="text-justify">
My whole life have been centered on sports, academics and values. One of my strengths is my ability to manage time. Since my childhood, I would always manage my schedule ahead since I was part of the Dominican Republic Table Tennis National Team and had to catch up with my school grades plus having a social life.

<h2 class="text-justify">My favorite place </h2>
<p class="text-justify">
My determination made me be part of the National Honor Society (NHS) this is a society that only chooses the best 60 students from the country based on academics and extracurricular activities. I like visiting and exploring new countries since I get exposed to different cultures, behaviors and their different day to day lifestyles. From the countries Iâ€™ve visited, my favorite country is France. France is the best country overall because of the multiple things to do, you could go to the beaches in the South, have a good time in Paris or even go to the Alps. Itâ€™s the best combination of environments, mountain, beach and architecture.
